 Welcome to my brief demonstration on what I\textquotesingle{}ve done for my final project in CSC 471, Winter 2024.

I\textquotesingle{}ve done a project here on the idea of Portals, from the hit game Portal made by Valve Software. I wanted to recreate the look and feel of the portals as much as I could within the given time limits.

My project requirements that I wanted to hit include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recreate the shimmering particle blue/orange particle effect on the border of the portal
\item Recreate the "{}look-\/through"{} effect of the portals
\item Create the physics/collision effects of going through portals
\item Create a level showing off these portal effects
\end{DoxyItemize}

Looking back at this, this was way, way too much to ask for in a week. But I did get some things done...\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Results}{Results}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
While I didn\textquotesingle{}t get my final project working in time up to how I wanted to, I\textquotesingle{}m really proud as to how organized and readible my code is. Feel free to look around the classes I\textquotesingle{}ve made on this webpage to see how I organized things like the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classMatrixStack}{Matrix\+Stack}}, as well as shaders and whatnot.

\end{DoxyImage}
   

Furthermore, as shown above, I\textquotesingle{}ve gotten particles working! Specifically, I\textquotesingle{}ve helped developed a particle-\/field definition for what forces particles experience relative to some origin.

Lastly, I\textquotesingle{}ve gotten \doxylink{classFBO}{FBO}\textquotesingle{}s, developed for use for the rendered textures on top of the portals, implemented, but not working. This was the thing that broke my program, as I had extreme difficulties importing a known working version of FBOs into my "{}classified"{} graphics program.

A final demo recording of the project is shown below\+:

I took notes on what references I used to begin looking at ideas for this project. If you\textquotesingle{}re curious, I would recommend taking a look at my notes page on\+:
